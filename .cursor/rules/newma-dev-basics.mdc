description: Core Newma dev rules (env, build, launch) that apply to the whole repo
---

# Newma Dev Basics

- Use Node 20 for all dev commands. Verified with v20.19.5. Prefer PATH prefix over switching global versions.
- Do not run `out/main.js` directly with Node. Always launch via Electron.
- Preferred launch path: `scripts/code.sh` (which runs preLaunch, syncs built-ins, then starts Electron).
- Keep changes minimal and repeatable; do not bypass steps to hide issues. Fix root causes.
- Product branding is Newma across all platforms. Icons must be platform-appropriate (macOS .icns, Windows .ico, Linux .png).

Quick commands:

```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"  # macOS/Homebrew example
npm ci
npm run compile
./scripts/code.sh
```
